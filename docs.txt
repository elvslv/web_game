Server receives JSON  messages sent via http POST. Typical responses are described below under TYPICAL RESPONSES title.

TYPICAL RESPONSES
	Response is a list of JSON objects created in following format:
		{
			'result': ans,
			other fileds with parameters 
		},
	ans can possess one of the following values:
		*ok: String or list containing this word in lower case usually means that operation went succesfully. 
		*badJson: Incorrent format of JSON message were received. Read the BASIC COMMANDS subsection below for more information on the subject.
		*badUsername: Entered username is not allowed. Check out "registration" command format in BASIC COMMANDS subsection.
		*badPassword: Entered password is not allowed. Same advice as before.
		*usernameTaken: Pretty much self-explanatory. Think up a new one.
		*badUsernameOrPassword: Either user with this username hasn't signed up yet or password differs from one entered during registration.
		*userLoggedIn: User were trying to log in without loggin' out first. Regrettably, it's not possible.

	For "login" query the second field is 
		"sid": sid
BASIC COMMANDS
	
	NOTE: Each command must be a list, that contains JSON objects. Each such JSON message should contain "action" field. Otherwise, 'badJson' error's to be expected.
