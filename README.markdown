SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
========
 
* Python 2.7
* sql-alchemy 0.6.8
* Apache HTTP Server 2.2.17 or higher
* mod_wsgi 3.3 or much, much higher

DEPLOYMENT
=========

Basically just configure apache + mod_wsgi like [here][ref] to run small_worlds.py script. It's so obvious why am I even writing it down. Oh, and run `python parseJson.py resetServer` to **reset server**.

That's all folks!
